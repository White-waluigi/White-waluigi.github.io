					Have you ever wondered what would happen if you invested your entire savings into the stock market for a few decades?
					This website documents the investment histories of 4 people; Gamble, Winston, Ludwig and Constantin. They are very similar people
					earning very similar amounts of money and having the same amount of savings.</br>
					Each of them saves 10000$ a year adjusted for inflation in 2020 for a better life after their retirement.<br/><br/>
					Constantin decides to deposit it on his bank account and just profiting of of banking interest.<br/>
					Gamble invests in new stocks every year.<br/>
					Ludwig invests in new stocks 10% of the time<br/>
					Winston picks a stock once and sticks to it for his entire career<br/>

				<h1 class="jumbotron-heading">Idea</h1>
				<p class="lead text-muted">

				The idea behind this project is to analyze different investing strategies and simulate a potential Investment history using personal savings using historical data. 
				In general the banking system is pitted against 3 (or more) stock market investment strategies.
				Especially in the current time of unsafe retirement planning, it might make sense to look at the stock market as a possible pension option. 
				</p>
				<h1 class="jumbotron-heading">Data</h1>
				<p class="lead text-muted">

				The Data consists of the stock and dividend histories of Dow Jones components which consist of the biggest and most commonly invested stocks, to avoid survivor bias.
				By using a market index as a starting point, the potential stock success is free from biases, which might appear by simply randomly choosing companies that are big today, such as Apple or Microsoft.
				The historical Dow Jones components are taken from 
				<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130603090457/http://www.dowjones.com/history.asp">Dow Jones History</a>
				and the historical stock data from them were downloaded and processed from 
				<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Finance</a> using an automated script.
				currently the site contains stocks from 35 companies.
				</p>
				<h1 class="jumbotron-heading">Tools</h1>
				<p class="lead text-muted">

				The website is running on Github Pages directly from the repository.
				The website was developed using apache and written with vim.
				Libraries used are bootstrap for visuals and popovers, D3 for data processing and moment.js for better datekeeping.
				</p>

				<h1 class="jumbotron-heading">Simulation</h1>
				<p class="lead text-muted">

				The site works by first loading all stocks into a market.
				Then potential stock histories for all 4 investors using different strategies are generated client side.
				Each Investor invests his savings yearly into stocks.
				The results are then graphed on the Website by the net worth of the investors over time
				</p>
				<h1 class="jumbotron-heading">Use</h1>
				<p class="lead text-muted">
				The tool can be used to test and compare different investment startegies or even as advertisment for brokerfirms.
				It also displays the benefits of long term investing in a way that anybody can understand them.
				</p>
				<h1 class="jumbotron-heading">Implemented Features</h1>
				<p class="lead text-muted">
				Currently, the basic features of the site work and the groundwork has been laid. So far about 30% of planned features are implemented.
				Over the next few weeks all of the planned features will be implemented with further ideas hopefully being implemented during winter break.
